This is a collection of recipes for building your own private packages of useful Windows utilities/accessories. The packages can be customized with your preferred settings and behavior, and then quickly installed from a central location onto each Windows computer that you use during your normal work.

To use these recipes, create a ``$build`` folder somewhere. For each recipe you want to use:

1. Follow the directions in ``$appname/$appname.md`` to create your personalized package under your ``$build`` folder.
2. Zip that folder and share with your other computers via a thumbdrive or a service like Mega.co.nz .
3. Extract each package you want on each of your computers to a convenient location like ``C:\Utils\$appname`` and run ``install.cmd`` .
